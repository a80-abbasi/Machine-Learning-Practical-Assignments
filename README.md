2. **EDA, Data Cleaning and Data Visualization**  
3. **Regression**: Training linear regressor with the help of various basis functions on Boston house prices dataset  
4. **Ensemble Learning and Decision Tree**: Implementing Adaboost algorithm on weak learner decision trees to classify non-linearly separable data  
5. **K-Means, EM and GMM**: Implementing EM for GMM algorithm for image segmentation. EM is initialized by K-Means results and K-Means is initialized by K-Means++ heuristic.
